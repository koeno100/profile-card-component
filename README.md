## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this exercise, what I especially learnt is how to set up a coherent layout using semantic HTML. On top of that, styling the design was challenging since it involved some backgrounds, images that were shifted in position and the circles in the background. What I also did now was exclusively using `rem` instead of `px` to get a fully responsive design that would react to any set font by the user.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my semantic HTML, flexbox and responsiveness skills. I also want to start focusing more on accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [Why you should never use px to set font-size in CSS](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/never-use-px-for-font-size) - Someone linked me to this article on why to use `rem` instead of `px`. Very clear and informative read!
